"Hi there! My name is Geo and I am passionate about coding. I have extensive knowledge in languages such as C++, JavaScript, and HTML, and I am currently expanding my skills by learning Python. Programming is not just a hobby for me, it's a way of life. I love being able to create new things and solve complex problems using code. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies or playing video games. I'm excited to see where my coding journey takes me next!"
